\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
This is the Robust Anti Spoofing Algorithm implementation using various algorithms.

The code is well explained.

\section{LBP : Local Binary Pattern}
LBP is an intelligent way of checking the illumination. 

The intorduction of this algorithm is found on page \pageref{sec:intro}
\subsection{How it works?}
The pattern is described by an illumination matrix which is  taken as relative to the central grid.
\subsubsection{It contains the image of the working of LBPs}
